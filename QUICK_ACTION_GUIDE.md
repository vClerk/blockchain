## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Payment Rules (Enforced by Smart Contract):

1. **✅ Farmer MUST be verified** - No exceptions
2. **✅ Scheme MUST be active** - Inactive schemes can't pay
3. **✅ Scheme MUST not be expired** - Check expiry date
4. **✅ Farmer can receive ONCE per scheme** - No duplicates
5. **✅ Contract MUST have balance** - Need to deposit funds first

### If Payment Fails:

**Error: "Farmer not verified"**
- Solution: Verify farmer first in Government Dashboard

**Error: "Scheme is not active"**
- Solution: Check scheme status, may be inactive or expired

**Error: "Farmer already received from this scheme"**
- Solution: Farmer already got payment, can't receive again

**Error: "Insufficient contract balance"**
- Solution: Deposit funds to contract first
