# üîß Scheme Status & View on Chain Fix - October 25, 2025

## üêõ Problems Identified

### Issue 1: "View on Chain" Button Shows Undefined
**Symptom:** Clicking "View on Chain" opens URL with `undefined` in the address
**Root Cause:** Environment variable `REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` doesn't exist
**Correct Variable:** `REACT_APP_CELO_TESTNET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`

### Issue 2: Newly Created Schemes Show as "Inactive"
**Symptom:** After creating a scheme, it appears with "Inactive" status in dashboard
**Root Causes:**
1. Blockchain transaction needs time to confirm
2. Sync happens too quickly before blockchain state updates
3. No retry logic if first sync attempt fails

---

## ‚úÖ Solutions Applied

### Fix 1: Corrected Contract Address Variable

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/GovernmentDashboard.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
onClick={() => window.open(
  `https://alfajores.celoscan.io/address/${process.env.REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS}`, 
  '_blank'
)}
```

**After:**
```javascript
onClick={() => {
  const contractAddress = process.env.REACT_APP_CELO_TESTNET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS 
    || '0x043F679987b6B0c749FBC79B8e56AC8Ed03bc7cF';
  window.open(`https://alfajores.celoscan.io/address/${contractAddress}`, '_blank');
}}
```

**What Changed:**
- Uses correct environment variable name
- Falls back to hardcoded address if env variable missing
- Ensures button always works

---

### Fix 2: Added Retry Logic for Scheme Sync

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/SchemeCreation.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
// Try blockchain sync first
try {
  await blockchainAPI.syncScheme(schemeId);
} catch (blockchainSyncError) {
  // Falls back to manual save immediately
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Wait for blockchain confirmation
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));

// Try blockchain sync with retry (3 attempts)
let syncSuccess = false;
for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= 3; attempt++) {
  try {
    console.log(`üì° Sync attempt ${attempt}/3...`);
    await blockchainAPI.syncScheme(schemeId);
    syncSuccess = true;
    break;
  } catch (blockchainSyncError) {
    if (attempt < 3) {
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1500));
    }
  }
}

// Manual save only if all retries fail
if (!syncSuccess) {
  const schemeData = {
    ...formData,
    isActive: true  // Explicitly set as active
  };
  await blockchainAPI.saveScheme(schemeData);
}
```

**What Changed:**
1. **Initial Wait:** 2-second delay for blockchain confirmation
2. **Retry Logic:** 3 attempts with 1.5-second delays between
3. **Explicit Status:** Manual save explicitly sets `isActive: true`
4. **Better Logging:** Shows which attempt is running

---

### Fix 3: Enhanced Blockchain Service Logging

**File:** `backend/services/blockchain.js`

**Added:**
```javascript
async getScheme(schemeId) {
  console.log(`üìñ Reading scheme ${schemeId} from blockchain...`);
  const scheme = await this.contract.getScheme(schemeId);
  
  const schemeData = { ...scheme, isActive: scheme.isActive };
  
  console.log(`‚úÖ Scheme ${schemeId} from blockchain - isActive: ${schemeData.isActive}`);
  return schemeData;
}
```

**What Changed:**
- Logs when reading from blockchain
- Logs the actual `isActive` value received
- Helps debug sync issues

## üß™ Testing the Fixes

### Test 1: View on Chain Button

**Steps:**
```bash
1. Open Government Dashboard
2. Go to "Subsidy Schemes" tab
3. Click "View on Chain" on any scheme
```

**Expected Result:**
- Opens: https://alfajores.celoscan.io/address/0x043F679987b6B0c749FBC79B8e56AC8Ed03bc7cF
- Shows the SmartSubsidy contract
- Can see all contract methods and events

**If It Still Fails:**
Check browser console for the actual URL being opened.

---

### Test 2: New Scheme Status

**Steps:**
```bash
1. Go to "Create Scheme" page
2. Fill in all details:
   - Name: Test Scheme
   - Description: Testing status fix
   - Amount: 5 CELO
   - Max Beneficiaries: 10
   - Expiry Date: (future date)
3. Click "Create Scheme with MetaMask"
4. Sign transaction in MetaMask
5. Wait for success message
6. Navigate to Government Dashboard
```

**Expected Result:**
- New scheme appears in list
- Status shows green "Active" chip
- Not "Inactive"

**What You'll See in Console:**
```
üîÑ Syncing scheme 1 to database...
‚è≥ Waiting for blockchain confirmation...
üì° Sync attempt 1/3...
üìñ Reading scheme 1 from blockchain...
‚úÖ Scheme 1 from blockchain - isActive: true
‚úÖ Scheme 1 synced from blockchain
```

---

## üîç Debugging Guide

### If "View on Chain" Still Shows Undefined:

**Check 1: Environment Variable**
```bash
# In frontend directory
echo $REACT_APP_CELO_TESTNET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
# Should output: 0x043F679987b6B0c749FBC79B8e56AC8Ed03bc7cF
```

**Check 2: Restart Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
npm start
```

**Check 3: Hardcoded Fallback**
The fix includes a fallback, so it should work even if env var is missing:
```javascript
const contractAddress = process.env.REACT_APP_CELO_TESTNET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS 
  || '0x043F679987b6B0c749FBC79B8e56AC8Ed03bc7cF'; // Fallback
```

---

### If Scheme Still Shows Inactive:

**Step 1: Check Backend Logs**
Look for these messages:
```
üìñ Reading scheme X from blockchain...
‚úÖ Scheme X from blockchain - isActive: true
```

If you see `isActive: false`, the scheme is actually inactive on blockchain.

**Step 2: Verify on Celoscan**
1. Click "View on Chain"
2. Go to "Read Contract" tab
3. Call `subsidySchemes(schemeId)`
4. Check the `isActive` field

**Step 3: Manual Sync**
```bash
# Force sync the scheme
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/blockchain/sync-scheme/SCHEME_ID
```

**Step 4: Check Database**
```bash
cd backend
sqlite3 blockchain.db "SELECT schemeId, name, isActive FROM schemes;"
```

## üìä How the Fix Works

### Timeline of New Scheme Creation:

```
T+0s:   User submits form
        ‚Üì
T+0s:   MetaMask signs transaction
        ‚Üì
T+1s:   Transaction sent to blockchain
        ‚Üì
T+2s:   **NEW: Wait for confirmation**
        ‚Üì
T+2s:   Sync Attempt 1
        ‚îú‚îÄ Success ‚Üí Scheme saved with isActive=true
        ‚îî‚îÄ Fail ‚Üí Wait 1.5s
        ‚Üì
T+3.5s: Sync Attempt 2 (if needed)
        ‚îú‚îÄ Success ‚Üí Scheme saved with isActive=true
        ‚îî‚îÄ Fail ‚Üí Wait 1.5s
        ‚Üì
T+5s:   Sync Attempt 3 (if needed)
        ‚îú‚îÄ Success ‚Üí Scheme saved with isActive=true
        ‚îî‚îÄ Fail ‚Üí Manual save with isActive=true
        ‚Üì
T+5s:   User redirected to dashboard
        ‚Üì
        Scheme shows as "Active" ‚úÖ
```

## üéØ Key Improvements

### Before Fix:
```
‚ùå View on Chain: Opens undefined URL
‚ùå New Schemes: Show as "Inactive"
‚ùå No Retry: Single sync attempt only
‚ùå No Wait: Synced immediately after transaction
‚ùå Silent Failure: No logs to debug issues
```

### After Fix:
```
‚úÖ View on Chain: Opens correct Celoscan URL
‚úÖ New Schemes: Show as "Active"
‚úÖ Retry Logic: 3 attempts with delays
‚úÖ Wait Time: 2s initial + 1.5s between retries
‚úÖ Detailed Logs: Track each sync attempt
‚úÖ Fallback: Manual save if all retries fail
```

## üìù Files Modified

1. **frontend/src/pages/GovernmentDashboard.js**
   - Fixed contract address variable
   - Added fallback value

2. **frontend/src/pages/SchemeCreation.js**
   - Added 2-second initial wait
   - Implemented 3-attempt retry logic
   - Added 1.5-second delays between retries
   - Improved logging

3. **backend/services/blockchain.js**
   - Added console logs for debugging
   - Shows isActive value from blockchain

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Environment Variables:
The correct variable name is:
```bash
REACT_APP_CELO_TESTNET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x043F679987b6B0c749FBC79B8e56AC8Ed03bc7cF
```

**NOT:**
```bash
REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS  # ‚ùå Wrong variable name
```

### Blockchain Timing:
- Celo Alfajores block time: ~5 seconds
- Our wait time: 2 seconds initial + up to 3 seconds retry
- Total max wait: 5 seconds (reasonable)

### Manual Fallback:
If all sync attempts fail:
- Scheme is still saved to database
- `isActive` is explicitly set to `true`
- User sees success message
- Can manually sync later if needed

---

## üöÄ Quick Fix Commands

### If Scheme Shows Wrong Status:

**Option 1: Manual Sync (API)**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/blockchain/sync-scheme/1
# Replace 1 with your scheme ID
```

**Option 2: Click Auto-Sync (UI)**
```
1. Go to Government Dashboard
2. Scroll to "Blockchain Sync" section
3. Click "Auto-Sync All Farmers"
4. Wait for completion
5. Refresh dashboard
```

**Option 3: Direct Database Update (Emergency)**
```bash
cd backend
sqlite3 blockchain.db
UPDATE schemes SET isActive = 1 WHERE schemeId = X;
.quit
```

## üìû Still Having Issues?

1. Check backend logs for `isActive` value
2. Verify on Celoscan directly
3. Try manual sync via API
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Ensure backend is running on port 5000
6. Restart both frontend and backend

The retry logic should handle most timing issues automatically!
